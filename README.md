## 🧩 How It Works

- The game starts on the splash screen with a **Play** button.  
- After clicking Play, it transitions to the game board.  
- Players alternate turns placing their marks:  
  - Player 1 uses **o**  
  - Player 2 uses **x***  
- The app checks for winning conditions after every move.  
- Once a player wins or the game is a draw, the board disables further moves.  
- Pressing **Reset** clears the board and starts a new game.
